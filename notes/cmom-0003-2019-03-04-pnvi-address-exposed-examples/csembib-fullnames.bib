semantics equipped with traces of input/output events that observes
both terminating and diverging executions.  The formal semantics of
Clight is mechanized using the Coq proof assistant. In addition
to the semantics of Clight, this article describes its integration
in the CompCert verified compiler and several ways by which the
semantics was validated.}

  OPTabstract = {Floating-point arithmetic is known to be tricky: roundings, formats,
exceptional values. The IEEE-754 standard was a push towards
straightening the field and made formal reasoning about floating-point
computations easier and flourishing. Unfortunately, this is not
sufficient to guarantee the final result of a program, as several
other actors are involved: programming language, compiler,
architecture.  The CompCert formally-verified compiler provides a
solution to this problem: this compiler comes with a mathematical
specification of the semantics of its source language (a large subset
of ISO C90) and target platforms (ARM, PowerPC, x86-SSE2), and with a
proof that compilation preserves semantics.  In this paper, we report
on our recent success in formally specifying and proving correct
CompCert's compilation of floating-point arithmetic.  Since CompCert
is verified using the Coq proof assistant, this effort required a
suitable Coq formalization of the IEEE-754 standard; we extended the
Flocq library for this purpose.  As a result, we obtain the first
formally verified compiler that provably preserves the semantics of
floating-point programs.}

  abstract = {A memory model is an important component of the formal semantics of imperative programming languages: it specifies the behavior of operations over memory states, such as reads and writes. The formally verified CompCert C compiler uses a sophisticated memory model that is shared between the semantics of its source language (the CompCert subset of C) and intermediate languages. The algebraic properties of this memory model play an important role in the proofs of semantic preservation for the compiler. The initial design of the CompCert memory model is described in an article by Leroy and Blazy (J. Autom. Reasoning 2008). The present research report describes version 2 of this memory model, improving over the main limitations of version 1. The first improvement is to expose the byte-level, in-memory representation of integers and floats, while preserving desirable opaqueness properties of pointer values. The second improvement is the integration of a fine-grained mechanism of permissions (access rights), which supports more aggressive optimizations over read-only data, and paves the way towards shared-memory, data-race-free concurrency in the style of Appel's Verified Software Toolchain project.}

This paper presents a formal verification with the Coq proof assistant
of a memory model for C-like imperative languages. This model defines
the memory layout and the operations that manage the memory. The model
has been specified at two levels of abstraction and implemented as
part of an ongoing certification in Coq of a moderately-optimising C
compiler. Many properties of the memory have been verified in the
specification. They facilitate the definition of precise formal
semantics of C pointers. A certified OCaml code implementing the
memory model has been automatically extracted from the
specifications.},

  title =        {Into the depths of {C}: elaborating the de facto standards},
abstract ={
C remains central to our computing infrastructure.  It is notionally defined by ISO standards, but in reality the properties of C assumed by systems code and those implemented by compilers have diverged, both from the ISO standards and from each other, and none of these are clearly understood.

We make two contributions to help improve this error-prone situation.  First, we describe an in-depth analysis of the design space for the semantics of pointers and memory in C as it is used in practice.  We articulate many specific questions, build a suite of semantic test cases, gather experimental data from multiple implementations, and survey what C experts believe about the de facto standards.  We identify questions where there is a consensus (either following ISO or differing) and where there are conflicts. We apply all this to an experimental C implemented above capability hardware.  Second, we describe a formal model, Cerberus, for large parts of C.  Cerberus is parameterised on its memory model; it is linkable either with a candidate de facto memory object model, under construction, or with an operational C11 concurrency model; it is defined by elaboration to a much simpler Core language for accessibility, and it is executable as a test oracle on small examples.

This should provide a solid basis for discussion of what mainstream C is now: what programmers and analysis tools can assume and what compilers aim to implement. Ultimately we hope it will be a step towards clear, consistent, and accepted semantics for the various use-cases of C.

The Java Memory Model has been shown to be unsound with respect to standard compiler optimisations, while the C/C++11 model is too weak, admitting undesirable thin-air executions. Our goal in this paper is to articulate this major open problem as clearly as is currently possible, showing how it arises from the combination of multiprocessor relaxed-memory behaviour and the desire to accommodate current compiler optimisations. We make several novel contributions that each shed some light on the problem, constraining the possible solutions and identifying new difficulties.},

  abstract={The semantics of pointers and memory objects in C has been a vexed question for many years.  C values cannot be treated as either purely abstract or purely concrete entities: the language exposes their representations, but compiler optimisations rely on analyses that reason about provenance and initialisation status, not just runtime representations. The ISO WG14 standard leaves much of this unclear, and in some respects differs with de facto standard usage --- which itself is difficult to investigate.

In this paper we explore the possible source-language semantics for memory objects and pointers, in ISO C and in C as it is used and implemented in practice, focussing especially on pointer provenance.  We aim to, as far as possible, reconcile the ISO C standard, mainstream compiler behaviour, and the semantics relied on by the corpus of existing C code.  We present two coherent proposals, tracking provenance via integers and not; both address many design questions. We highlight some pros and cons and open questions, and illustrate the discussion with a library of test cases.  We make our semantics executable as a test oracle, integrating it with the Cerberus semantics for much of the rest of C, which we have made substantially more complete and robust, and equipped with a web-interface GUI.  This allows us to experimentally assess our proposals on those test cases.  To assess their viability with respect to larger bodies of C code, we analyse the changes required and the resulting behaviour for a port of FreeBSD to CHERI, a research architecture supporting hardware capabilities, which (roughly speaking) traps on the memory safety violations which our proposals deem undefined behaviour. We also develop a new runtime instrumentation tool to detect possible provenance violations in normal C code, and apply it to some of the SPEC benchmarks.  We compare our proposal with a source-language variant of the twin-allocation LLVM semantics proposal of Lee et al.  Finally, we describe ongoing interactions with WG14, exploring how our proposals could be incorporated into the ISO standard.
